# LinkedinScraper

I developed a linkedin-scraper which collects data from a person's Linkedin profile. 
The inspiration of this project comes from my internship with SYA ([School Year Abroad](https://www.sya.org/)) where I researched constituents and 
inputted their data into SYA's database. So I created this project to help me gather data in a more efficient manner.
